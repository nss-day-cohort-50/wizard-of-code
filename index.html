                    <h1>The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film</h1>
                    <p>When a tornado rips through Kansas, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog, Toto, are whisked away in
                        their house to the magical land of Oz. They follow the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City
                        to meet the Wizard, and en route they meet a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) that needs a brain, a Tin
                        Man (Jack Haley) missing a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who wants courage. The wizard
                        asks the group to bring him the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) to
                        earn his help.</p>

                    <h4>'The Wizard of Oz’ Remake: It’s Hard to Follow the Famous Yellow Brick Road</h4>
                    <p>L. Frank Baum’s beloved children’s book “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” has been adapted in various
                        forms over the years, but at this point we have no idea what version to expect from director
                        Nicole Kassell.</p>

                    <h4>The Ruby Slippers</h4>
                    <p>The ruby slippers are the magic pair of shoes worn by Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in
                        the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film The Wizard of Oz. Because of their iconic stature, the
                        ruby slippers are among the most valuable items of film memorabilia. A number of pairs were made
                        for the film, though the exact number is unknown. Five pairs are known to have survived; one
                        pair was stolen from a museum in 2005 and recovered in 2018.</p>
